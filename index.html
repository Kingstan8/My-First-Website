<h2>FRUIT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<img src="Mango.jpg" width="100px" height="100px">
<p><span> Mango</span> is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera<br>
	indica. It is believed to have originated between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh,<br> 
	and northeastern India.[1] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia<br> 
	since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type"<br> 
	and the "Southeast Asian type".[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce<br> 
	edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the <br>
	Malesian ecoregion </p>
